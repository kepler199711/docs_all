- Plan Fee: The default validity plan period is 30 days. If the actual usage is less than 30 days after activation, it will still be counted as 30 days.
- Plan Upgrade: If you upgrade to a higher plan when using a lower plan, the fee and validity period will be recalculated based on the new plan, and the fee for the original lower plan will not be refunded. The same applies if you downgrade from a higher plan to a lower plan.

### Content moderation fee

If you need In-app Chat content moderation service, please refer to [Content Moderation - Overview](!zim-ModerationOverview).

After activating the content moderation service, you will receive a 7-day free trial. After the free trial period, In-app Chat will start tracking your actual usage on a daily basis and bill and settle the fee on the following day.

Please contact ZEGOCLOUD business personnel for pricing details.

## Example

### Scenario

If you subscribe to the Pro plan and have a MAU of 15,000.

To meet your demands, you also want the following add-on services:
- Increase the maximum number of group members to 4,000.
- Increase the maximum number of friends to 5,000.

This means you need to pay for the basic Pro plan fee and the fee for exceeding the free quota, as well as the fees for 2 add-ons of increasing the maximum group member" and 2 add-ons of increasing the maximum friend.

### Fee details

#### Plan fees

With a MAU of 15,000 for the month, subtracting the free quota of 10,000 MAU included in the Pro plan, the additional billed MAU is 5,000. Therefore:

Plan Fees = US\$369 + US\$0.015 × 5,000 = US\$444

#### Add-on fees

For the month, you have used 2 add-ons of increasing the maximum group member" and 2 add-ons of increasing the maximum friend. The usage fees for these add-ons are calculated on a monthly basis. Therefore:

Add-on fees = US\$99 × 2 + US\$99 × 2 = US\$396

#### Total cost

**Total cost: Plan fees + Add-on fees = US\$840**
