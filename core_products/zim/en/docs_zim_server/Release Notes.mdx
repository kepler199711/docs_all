| ----------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| Multi-item Messages | ZIM newly supports multi-item messages, allowing multiple content items in a single message, including text, images, audio, video, files, and custom messages. This message type enables various combinations such as text + image, text + video, and text + audio to flexibly meet diverse scenarios. | [MessageBody Description](./Messaging/MessageBody%20Introduction.mdx) |
| Query Messages | ZIM server supports querying multiple messages within a single specified conversation (one-to-one chat or group chat) by passing a list of MsgSeq. | [Query Messages](./Messaging/Query%20messages.mdx) |
