}
```

## Return response

A status code of 2XX (such as 200) indicates success, and other responses indicate failure.

## Callback retry strategy

If the ZEGOCLOUD server does not receive a response, or the HTTP status code received by the ZEGOCLOUD server is not 2xx (such as 200), it will retry with intervals of 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, and 32s respectively. If the retry still fails after an interval of 32s, it will no longer retry.
